# Content

The repository contains a demo application to show some of the possibilities that this widget provides.

‚ö† To make this code work, you need to replace the API key in the [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/xeladu/flutter_google_maps/blob/main/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) and [AppDelegate.swift](https://github.com/xeladu/flutter_google_maps/blob/main/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift). The current keys are just placeholders! Refer to the article for details.
